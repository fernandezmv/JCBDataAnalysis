Ulloa was the first to study how the rafts actually operated. The text notes that they were capable of deep sea navigation, 80 to 100 feet long, 20 to 26 feet wide, and able to carry 20 to 25 tons of cargo. The native Americans and mulattos moved their entire families onto them in the rainy season when they were cut off from their small farms. From the rafts they fished and subsisted on preserved meats and grains. Ulloa discovered how the rafts were able to tack by shifting the sails and be steered by means of guares.

Brown on the coast of Peru and Ecuador, particularly in the province of Quito. It may be Cinchona officinalis. Tecamez was a native American village near Quito. Brown found it more efficacious than the Peruvian bark then used in Europe. Cinchona, native to the Andean highlands from Bolivia to Colombia and to parts of Panama and Costa Rica, was named in honor of the countess of Chinchón who, legend says, was cured of a fever in 1638 by a preparation of the bark. There are about 40 species of the tree. The bark is also known as Jesuit's bark and Peruvian bark.Lambert was a British botanist and one of the first members of the Linnaean Society. He is best known for his description of the genus Pinus; the genus Lambertia is named for him. Some of the species of cinchona are described from examples in the herbarium of Sir Joseph Banks.

Robinson, 1798 edition.The French decided to mount a scientific and exploration voyage to rival that of Captain James Cook. Two ships, the Boussole and the Astrolabe, under La Perouse's command left France in August 1785. They spent the summer of 1786 off the coasts of Alaska looking for a northwest passage then sailed down the west coast of North America in August and September 1786. In September they crossed the Pacific Ocean to Asia. They first sailed north and then south to Australia which they reached in January 1788. In mid-March both ships were wrecked on a coral reef near the island of Vanikoro with all hands lost. Thirty years later remains were found, and islanders reported that survivors had built a boat and headed out to sea, but none were ever heard from again.La Perouse sent letters back to Europe from Manila, Macao, and Australia; this is how the voyage is known. In October 1787 he had also sent a Russian-speaking officer, Jean Baptiste Barthélemy, Baron de Lesseps (1766-1834) overland from Kamchatka with documents, charts, and journals. De Lesseps traveled through Siberia to St. Petersburg and then to Paris, arriving late in 1788. In May 1791, when it seemed clear that La Pérouse would not return, the revolutionary government commissioned former army officer Louis Antoine Milet-Mureau (1756-1825) to edit a book from these materials, which was published in Paris in four volumes with an atlas in 1797. A second French edition was required the following year, and English translations appeared in 1798, 1799, 1801, and 1807; German and Dutch editions were published between 1799 and 1804.",1751-1800,http://www.americanjourneys.org/aj-131/summary/index.asp (Oct. 2006),,Acquired before 1870.,,Flora and fauna,,,,Natural history--Chile,Botany--Chile,,,,,,
