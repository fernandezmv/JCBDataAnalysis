To the right are three bells and above the bells are two churches.","Beaumont, Pablo de la Purísima Concepción",[Crónica de Michoacán de Ocampo (Mexico)],,,1780,"This image, possibly copied in the late eighteenth century from an unknown sixteenth century original, relates to a disagreement between Bishop Vasco de Quiroga, the first bishop of Michoacán, and the native nobility over the bishop's decision to transfer the seat of his new diocese from the native capital of Tzintzuntzan to Pátzcuaro. Quiroga transferred the seat of his new see the day after he was consecrated on August 6, 1538. The Franciscan on the left is Fray Jerónimo de Alcalá, credited with being the first to write in Tarascan or Purépecha. Above the men are two natives named Francisco Tariyácuri and Antonio VItzimángari (also known as Tariácuri and Huitsiméngari), sons of the last native king of Michoacán, Cazonci Tzintzicha Tangazuan, who was executed in 1530 by the Spanish governor of New Spain, Nuño de Guzmán. The earliest Christian structure in the area was Santa Ana, shown at the upper right of the image. Below it is what seems to be a later church. The small tower is labeled ""Alabentaro hatitacurini, cacntztiyo,"" (meaning in mixed Spanish and native language, ""The ancient oratory now in ruins"").

Illustrated with about 1200 annotated woodcuts in the text by Gesner/ Camerarius (Iochino Camerario) originally used by Mattioli. Gesner had been preparing material for a massive historia plantarum but died before finishing the task. Camerarius acquired the material, utilized the woodcuts and supplemented them with his own designs. The woodcuts are remarkable in their scientific detail especially in the enlarged depictions of floral structure, seeds, and fruit. First appearing in 1586, these woodcuts became a convention in scientific botanical illustration.

The ruins consist of a cemetery, solar observatories, roads, storage areas, priests' chambers, and a native square. Balsa rafts were known to Europeans since 1527 when first seen by Pizarro's pilot. Ulloa was the first to study how the rafts actually operated. The text notes that they were capable of deep sea navigation, 80 to 100 feet long, 20 to 26 feet wide, and able to carry 20 to 25 tons of cargo. The native Americans and mulattos moved their entire families onto them in the rainy season when they were cut off from their small farms. From the rafts they fished and subsisted on preserved meats and grains. Ulloa discovered how the rafts were able to tack by shifting the sails and be steered by means of guares.
